# CI-CD Pipeline

Task 5. CI-CD Pipeline
Create a CI-CD pipeline for a sample application using any CI-CD tool of your choice like
Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Gitlab, Github Actions, AWS CodePipeline or any other tool of your
choice. Include a code build and a docker build step in your pipeline.

## Tool used for my CI-CD Pipeline 
  - Github Actions    

## Note
  - This repo is just to show the files that I used to complete this task.
  - The actual application where I created the CI-CD pipeline is in this repo:

    - https://github.com/rohithgadu/java-rest-api
    - I used the application that I built in the Task-1 

  - The gradel.yml file can be found in the above repo at java-rest-api/.github/workflows/gradel.yml

  - The gradel.yml includes the code build and Docker built of the application and then
    pushing the docker image to my docker-hub.

  - Workflows can be seen at:
